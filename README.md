# GNUCash tools

This repository holds various scripts I use with [GNUCash](http://gnucash.org/), mostly to convert to [ledger](http://www.ledger-cli.org/), although I have some additional reporting scripts in progress. Please note that the code assumes that the name of the gnucash file you wish to process is `personal.gnucash`; this file cannot be gzipped.
